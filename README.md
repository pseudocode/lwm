# lwm - the Lightweight Window Manager

LWM stands for Lightweight Window Manager. It is a window manager for the X11
window system. LWM has a limited feature set, and does not take on the tasks
that are better delegated to independent programs.

LWM is a classical reparenting window manager. This means it decorates client
windows with a title bar and border, and allows them to be moved and resized
by dragging these areas with the mouse.

IMPORTANT: If you run LWM the first time, note that you can start an xterm by
middle-clicking on the desktop background. This allows you to start other
programs, should you not have a launcher running.

## Principles of LWM

Once upon a time, LWM was simply the window manager that tries to keep out of
your face. This was Elliott's original paradigm, and it's a good one.

Since then, Phil's been doing much of the recent development, and has come to
add his own paradigm. Thus, LWM is the window manager that:

  * Keeps out of your face.
  * Puts you, the user, in control.

LWM will not attempt to second-guess you. It will not force unwanted features
on you. It will not take over responsibilities that are better undertaken by
some other program. It will behave in a simple, predictable manner.

It will also support features that put you in control, such as the ability for
you to control window titles when you want to (see below).

Essentially, you own this machine. It's yours. So it should damned well be doing
exactly what *you* want it to do.

## Features that LWM provides

### Moving/resizing

Using the fairly standard window borders and title bar, you can raise, move,
resize, close and iconise a window.

The left button will move the window from the title bar, or resize it from the
edges. The middle button will always move the window, but won't bring it to
the top of the window stack.

### Changing window stacking order

Left click on a window's title or border will bring it to the top of the window
stack; shift+right click on same will push it to the bottom.

### Hiding/unhiding windows

Also known as 'iconifying', except LWM doesn't clutter your desktop with icons.
Right-clicking (without Shift) on a window's title or border will make it
disappear.

Holding down the right button on the desktop background opens a menu. At the
top of this menu (above the dotted line) are hidden windows. Visible windows
are shown below the dotted line.

Moving the mouse over items in this menu will show a red box around where the
corresponding window is, or where it will appear if you make it visible again.
Releasing the right button over one of the menu items will make it appear if
it was hidden, bring it to the top of the window stack, and give it input focus.

### Configuration

You can configure things about LWM using Xresources. See the lwm.man page for
details, or look at the 'testXresources' file for an example.

Things you can configure include:

  * Colours. All of them.
  * Fonts and sizes.
  * Whether to display application icons in window title bars and/or the
    unhide menu.
  * Whether to use sloppy-focus or click-to-focus.
  * Border widths, and whether to include a resize border at the top of the
    title bar.
  * Commands to run when the user clicks left or middle buttons on the desktop
    background.
  * Commands to run when the user clicks left or middle buttons with the `Alt`
    key held, on the title bar of a window.

### XRandR support

LWM does not auto-detect monitors or provide a UI to select monitor rotation,
location etc. However, it does understand the XRandR protocol, and when the
configuration of your monitors changes it will react, ensuring windows are
sensibly arranged and that nothing gets lost in some inaccessible corner.

One recommendation is to use a hotkey program like `speckeysd` to run a script
that sets up your screens with the xrandr command-line tool. That way you have
complete and explicit control over what happens, without relying on what can be
rather flaky screen auto-detection software.

### Other basic obvious stuff

  * UTF8 everywhere.


## Features that LWM does NOT provide

### Colourmaps

X still has support for colour maps. Well, LWM completely ignores them, and
doesn't fully support anything less than 24bpp displays. This does make modern
LWM unsuitable for ancient monochrome X terminals, but if you're using one of
those it's in a museum anyway, and hopefully you don't mind not having the
latest version of LWM.

### Button bars / Docks

LWM is not an 'environment'. It is not a launcher. It is a window manager.
If you want a launcher, I'd suggest gummiband, but you can also use any other
launcher you like. This is the beauty of X11 - you can mix and match.

### Hotkeys

LWM has no hotkeys. It understands certain keyboard modifiers like Alt and
Shift when combined with mouse actions, but it does not support hotkeys.
If you want to run programs on hotkey presses, consider using speckeysd.
Or, you can use any other hotkey program you like. This is the beauty of X11 -
you can mix and match.

If you want to control window sizes, locations etc using hotkeys, please use
programs like `xdotool` to help you with that.

### Virtual desktops

LWM doesn't support the EWMH protocol for virtual desktops. That is, the ability
to switch between multiple desktops, and have different clients visible on
different desktops.

There's no reason why LWM cannot support the protocol, and indeed the window
manager's collaboration is required to make the protocol work at all. If you
want this functionality added to LWM, please feel free to contribute the code.
Note, however, that the UI and/or hotkey support for viewing and switching
virtual desktops should be provided by a separate program, not as part of LWM
itself. As previously stated, LWM is a window manager, not an environment.

### Animations, drop-shadows, etc

LWM is not a compositing window manager. In the brave new world of Wayland,
where the dark and complex history of X11 is set aside and a saner system built,
compositors make sense. But compositors in X11 are slow and inefficient.
LWM is for people who care more about stuff happening fast than stuff happening
prettily.
